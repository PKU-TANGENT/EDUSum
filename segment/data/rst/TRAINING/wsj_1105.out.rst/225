 But the news was even worse for Sears's core U.S. retailing operation, the largest in the nation.

 Sears said

7
its U.S. stores had a loss of $6.9 million, their first deficit for the period in more than five years.

Analysts estimated

 The results underscore Sears's difficulties

Under the new approach, Sears set prices

that is being distorted by a very harsh climate for sales of durable goods,
